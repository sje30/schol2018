              circulate biological preprints in a forgotten experiment called
              the Information Exchange Groups (IEGs). This system eventually
              attracted over 3,600 participants and saw the production of over
              2,500 different documents, but by 1967, it was effectively shut
              down following the refusal of journals to accept articles that
              had been circulated as preprints. This article charts the rise
              and fall of the IEGs and explores the parallels with the 1990s

  abstract = "A number of publishers and funders, including PLOS, have recently
              adopted policies requiring researchers to share the data
              underlying their results and publications. Such policies help
              increase the reproducibility of the published literature, as well
              as make a larger body of data available for reuse and
              re-analysis. In this study, we evaluate the extent to which
              authors have complied with this policy by analyzing Data
              Availability Statements from 47,593 papers published in PLOS ONE
              between March 2014 (when the policy went into effect) and May
              2016. Our analysis shows that compliance with the policy has
              increased, with a significant decline over time in papers that
              did not include a Data Availability Statement. However, only
              about 20\% of statements indicate that data are deposited in a
              repository, which the PLOS policy states is the preferred method.
              More commonly, authors state that their data are in the paper
              itself or in the supplemental information, though it is unclear
              whether these data meet the level of sharing required in the PLOS
              policy. These findings suggest that additional review of Data
              Availability Statements or more stringent policies may be needed
              to increase data sharing.",

              subscriptions, OA article-processing charges (APCs), and new

  abstract = "Progress in science relies in part on generating hypotheses with
              existing observations and testing hypotheses with new
              observations. This distinction between postdiction and prediction
              is appreciated conceptually but is not respected in practice.
              Mistaking generation of postdictions with testing of predictions
              reduces the credibility of research findings. However, ordinary
              biases in human reasoning, such as hindsight bias, make it hard
              to avoid this mistake. An effective solution is to define the
              research questions and analysis plan before observing the
              research outcomes-a process called preregistration.
              Preregistration distinguishes analyses and outcomes that result
              from predictions from those that result from postdictions. A
              variety of practical strategies are available to make the best
              possible use of preregistration in circumstances that fall short
              of the ideal application, such as when the data are preexisting.
              Services are now available for preregistration across all
              disciplines, facilitating a rapid increase in the practice.
              Widespread adoption of preregistration will increase
              distinctiveness between hypothesis generation and hypothesis
              testing and will improve the credibility of research findings.",
