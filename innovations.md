Therefore, I wanted to get in touch as we are putting together an issue of our interdisciplinary journal, Emerging Topics in Life Sciences<http://www.emergtoplifesci.org/>, on the scholarly publishing landscape, with the focus being on the current impact on and implications for life science researchers. The issue would cover a number of aspects of the scholarly publishing landscape, including research data, open science, persistent identifiers, models of peer review, research ethics, and we would like to cover the view from a life science researcher. In particular, thinking about the following questions:


*         What does the scholarly publishing landscape look like in 2018 (from a life scientists perspective)?

*         What are the considerations, regulations and expectations from the perspective of a life science researcher, and what do the pros and cons of compliance look like to them?

*         How are emerging topics in scholarly publishing improving or holding back the science?

Would you be interested in writing a short perspective piece on emerging topics in scholarly publishing and the impact and implication for the life science researcher? We are asking for short (approx. 1000-1500 words) pieces. Given that this issue needs to be published before the end of the year, we would need submission of the piece in the next few weeks (1 November deadline).

# Introduction

In some ways, the state of scholarly publishing has not changed much
in the last ten years.  Publishing in a top-tier journal is still perceived
as critical for career progression (promotion, gaining grants) by
scientists.  Likewise, journal metrics continue to dominate in the
evalution of a paper's research, rather than reading the paper itself
(Brenner).  However, there are several reasons for optimism that the
nature of scientific publishing will improve.  Here we outline some
recent deveopments in the life sciences.

## Preprints

Physicists (since 1992?) have heralded the preprint server Arxiv as a
rapid way of disseminating their research findings.  On the surface,
it does not provide much beyond a collection of PDFs grouped by
topic.  In certain fields, being the first to publish on the Arxiv is
considered to be critical, rather than publishing in a journal.
Although Arxiv hosts papers in quantitative biology, it was assumed
that biologists would not adopt a preprint culture.  A primary reason
for this was simply that publishing a preprint might prevent
subsequent publication in a top-tier journal, or leading to scooping
by another group.

Biorxiv, launched in 2010?, has changed this. Researchers in diverse
areas as ecology, neuroscience, genomics are uploading preprints and
choosing to share their work ahead of publication.  There are many
reasons for this usage:

* Sharing work before submitting to a journal allows for community
  feedback.
* Sharing work at the time of submission means that the community can
  read the work months (or years) before the work eventually
  appears in print.
* Journal editors are browsing the biorxiv and soliciting that
  relevant papers be submitted to their journal.  (How widespread this
  is, I'm not sure.)
* Biorxiv Preprints can be transferred rapidly to journal submission
  sytems rather than going through (often lengthy) direct submission
  to the journal.
* Several funding agencies, including NIH and UKRI, allows
  preprints to be listed and cited in grant applications.
  
Biorxiv submissions continue to increase rapidly (e.g. XXX / year in
2015, now YYY Jan-Oct 2018).  Unlike a few years ago, very few (if
any?)  journals in the life sciences now regard a preprint as prior
publication of that work.  Biorxiv can even be used as the substrate
for an overlay journal (example?), and we look forward to the creation
of prominent diamond OA overlay journals in the life sciences.

## Preregistration studies

According to recent surveys, life scientists across many domains
believe there is a "reproducibility crisis" in science: i.e. key
findings of a paper have not been independently verified [refs].  An
encouraging response to this crisis has been the adoption of
preregistratation papers [Nosek 2018].  These papers typically describe the
introduction and methods sections of a paper, and are peer-reviewed
*before* the study is actually performed.  This allows reviewers to
improve the study design and commits researchers to hypotheses that
they wish to study along with their statistical analysis.  Once the
pre-registration study is approved, it is then published.  After the
research is completed, another paper describes the results of the
study using the pre-registered methods.  (Additional findings can be
reported, but are clearly marked as such.)  Preregistration is
most prevalent today in psychology.



## Other recent innovations of note

PubPeer <https://pubpeer.com/> allows for the open critique and
commentary of publications.

Orcid <https://orcid.org> provides a digital identifier for
researchers.  Journals are adopting these allowing for easy linking of paper.

DORA -- declaration for individiauls and institutions to commit to
evaluating research based on its content rather than metrics.  Many
funders in the UK have signed up, although only a few Universites to
date have signed.

**Post publication peer review**.  Journal that immediately publish a
paper upon submission; reviews are then sought for the preprint and
then made public.  If sufficient reviewers support publication, the
article is then published and then listed on pubmed.  Key examples of
this approach are F1000 Research, who provide the infrastructure for
several institution- and funder-specific journals, such as *Wellcome
Open Research* and  *Gates Open Research*.

**Format free submissions**.  Journals have traditionally imposed
strict formatting requirements for manuscripts before peer review.
As editors at top-tier journals 'desk reject' most submissions before
peer review, this leads to many wasted hours [Budd 2017].  Gradually
life science journals are now dropping these formatting requirements
for initial submissions, instead allowing "format free" submissions.

**Badges** to promote sharing of resrouces, rather than just the
papers.  e.g. mention data papers?  (Not sure whether to includes
this.)


## Funder mandates and compliance

Key Funders in the UK have had policies in place supporting open
access for many years.  IN particular, the Wellcome Trust has mandated
Open Access for publications funded by them since 2006, with sanctions
for non-compliance.  Compliance rates (around 90%) are highest for the
WT, as of October 2017 [ref Nature paper], with compliance for other
UK funders varying at 50-90% [check].  Where work has been supported by
relevant funding agencies, our experience to date is that funds have
always been available to support APCs.  However, one of us [SJE] has
experienced difficulties in finding APCs for papers summarising work
supported by internal, rather than external, funds.


One perhaps unintended consequence of these policies has been that
most traditional journals have established a "hybrid" model of
publishing, with APCs that often exceed those in pure OA journals.
This hybrid model of publishing has shown little signs to date of
disappearing, as e.g. funds from Wellcome Trust have supported high
APCs.  However, this may change with the recent announcement of "plan
S" [ref], a European initiative to enforce OA, cap APCs and prohibit
publishing in hybrid journals.  Whilst we support the notions
underlying plan S, until further details are released (e.g. the nature
of the APC cap, recognition of green and diamond OA).
