Therefore, I wanted to get in touch as we are putting together an
issue of our interdisciplinary journal, Emerging Topics in Life
Sciences <http://www.emergtoplifesci.org/>, on the scholarly publishing
landscape, with the focus being on the current impact on and
implications for life science researchers. The issue would cover a
number of aspects of the scholarly publishing landscape, including
research data, open science, persistent identifiers, models of peer
review, research ethics, and we would like to cover the view from a
life science researcher. In particular, thinking about the following
questions:


*         What does the scholarly publishing landscape look like in
          2018 (from a life scientists perspective)?

*         What are the considerations, regulations and expectations
          from the perspective of a life science researcher, and what
          do the pros and cons of compliance look like to them?

*         How are emerging topics in scholarly publishing improving or holding back the science?

Would you be interested in writing a short perspective piece on
emerging topics in scholarly publishing and the impact and implication
for the life science researcher? We are asking for short
(approx. 1000-1500 words) pieces. Given that this issue needs to be
published before the end of the year, we would need submission of the
piece in the next few weeks (1 November deadline).  </pre>



# Scholarly publishing in the life sciences: the life scientists' perspective.

**Warning**: almost all data/numbers in here are wrong -- I've just
drafted this in the mode of "get it written, don't get it right".
I'll check the data (e.g. for biorxiv), add refs, as I go along this
weekend time-permitting.

# Introduction

In some ways, the state of scholarly publishing has not changed much
in the last ten years.  Publishing in a top-tier journal is still
perceived as critical for career progression (promotion, gaining
grants) by scientists.  Likewise, journal metrics continue to dominate
in the evalution of a paper's research, rather than reading the paper
itself (Brenner).  However, there are several reasons for optimism
that the nature of scientific publishing will improve.  Here we
outline some recent deveopments in the life sciences.

## Preprints

Since 1991 physicists have heralded the preprint server ArXiv
[Ginsparg 2017] as a rapid way of disseminating their research
findings.  On the surface, it does not provide much beyond a
collection of PDFs grouped by topic.  In certain fields, being the
first to publish on the ArXiv is considered to be critical, rather
than publishing in a journal.  Although ArXiv hosts papers in
quantitative biology, it was assumed that biologists would not adopt a
preprint culture: publishing a preprint might prevent subsequent
publication in a top-tier journal, or leading to scooping by another
group.

BiorXiv, launched in 2013, has overcome these concerns. Researchers in
diverse areas as ecology, neuroscience, genomics are uploading
preprints and choosing to share their work ahead of publication.
There are many reasons for this usage:

* Sharing work before submitting to a journal allows for community
  feedback.
* Sharing work at the time of submission means that the community can
  read the work months (or years) before the work eventually
  appears in print.
* Journal editors are browsing the bioRxiv and soliciting that
  relevant papers be submitted to their journal.  (How widespread this
  is, I'm not sure.)
* BioRxiv preprints can be transferred rapidly to journal submission
  sytems rather than going through (often lengthy) direct submission
  to the journal.
* Several funding agencies, including NIH and UKRI, allows
  preprints to be listed and cited in grant applications.
  
BioRxiv submissions continue to increase rapidly (e.g. XXX / year in
2015, now YYY Jan-Oct 2018).  Unlike a few years ago, very few (if
any?)  journals in the life sciences now regard a preprint as prior
publication of that work.  BioRxiv can even be used as the substrate
for an overlay journal (example?), and we look forward to the creation
of prominent diamond OA overlay journals in the life sciences.

## Preregistration studies

According to recent surveys, life scientists across many domains
believe there is a "reproducibility crisis" in science: i.e. key
findings of a paper have not been independently verified [refs].  An
encouraging response to this crisis has been the adoption of
preregistratation papers [Nosek 2018].  These papers typically describe the
introduction and methods sections of a paper, and are peer-reviewed
*before* the study is actually performed.  This allows reviewers to
improve the study design and commits researchers to hypotheses that
they wish to study along with their statistical analysis.  Once the
pre-registration study is approved, it is then published.  After the
research is completed, another paper describes the results of the
study using the pre-registered methods.  (Additional findings can be
reported, but are clearly marked as such.)  Preregistration is
most prevalent today in psychology.



## Other recent innovations of note


ORCiD <https://orcid.org> provides a persistent, unique digital identifier for
researchers.  Many journals now require that at least one author verifies their identity as author using ORCiD. Cite https://orcid.org/content/requiring-orcid-publication-workflows-open-letter This will undoubtedly help reduce many types of authorship fraud (cite http://nautil.us/issue/42/fakes/why-fake-data-when-you-can-fake-a-scientist ?)  

DORA https://sfdora.org/ -- declaration for individiauls and institutions to commit to
evaluating research based on its content rather than metrics.  Many
funders in the UK have signed up, although only a few Universites to
date have signed. See also the Leiden Manifesto for Research Metrics which is similar but different (http://www.leidenmanifesto.org/).

**Published Peer Review Reports**.
Many journals now already or have pledged to provide greater transparency about the quality of peer review they provide by publishing the content of the reviewer reports alongside published articles. Notably two large open access publishers PLOS and MDPI are amongst those that are pledging to provide greater transparency from 2019 http://asapbio.org/letter Crossref can now register DOIs for peer review reports as a distinct content type, and formally link these to the DOIs of the articles they review (cite: https://www.crossref.org/news/2018-06-05-introducing-metadata-for-peer-review/ ). PubPeer <https://pubpeer.com/> allows reviewers to 'claim' metadata records on their profile for peer reviews and editorial work they have done.

**Post publication peer review**.  Journal that immediately publish a
paper upon submission; reviews are then sought for the preprint and
then made public.  If sufficient reviewers support publication, the
article is then published and then listed on pubmed.  Key examples of
this approach are F1000 Research, who provide the infrastructure for
several institution- and funder-specific journals, such as *Wellcome
Open Research* and  *Gates Open Research*.

**Format free submissions**.  Journals have traditionally imposed
strict formatting requirements for manuscripts before peer review.
As editors at top-tier journals 'desk reject' most submissions before
peer review, this leads to many wasted hours [Budd 2017].  Gradually
life science journals are now dropping these formatting requirements
for initial submissions, instead allowing "format free" submissions [
see also; https://asntech.github.io/format-free-journals/].

**Stronger data sharing policies and community expectations**
Perhaps cite: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194768


**Badges** to promote sharing of resources, rather than just the
papers.  e.g. mention data papers?  (Not sure whether to include
this.) (Ross: I'm not that enthused about badges https://blogs.plos.org/absolutely-maybe/2017/08/29/bias-in-open-science-advocacy-the-case-of-article-badges-for-data-sharing/ )


## Funder mandates and compliance

Key Funders in the UK have had policies in place supporting open
access for many years.  IN particular, the Wellcome Trust has mandated
Open Access for publications funded by them since 2006, with sanctions
for non-compliance.  Compliance rates (around 90%) are highest for the
WT, as of October 2017 [Larivière and Sugimoto 2018], with compliance
for other main funders varying at 70-90%.  Where work has been
supported by relevant funding agencies, our experience to date is that
funds have always been available to support APCs.  However, one of us
[SJE] has experienced difficulties in finding APCs for papers
summarising work supported by internal, rather than external, funds.


One perhaps unintended consequence of these policies has been that
most traditional journals have established a "hybrid" model of
publishing, with APCs that on average exceed those in pure OA journals (cite https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.23742 or a reference within).
This hybrid model of publishing has shown little signs to date of
disappearing, as e.g. funds from Wellcome Trust have supported high
APCs. The success of OA publishing however has meant that
goverment-provided funds can often no longer cover all APCs and UK
institutions are beginning to restrict the choice of journals for
which APCs will be paid.

The OA publishing world is about to change with the recent
announcement of "plan S" [ref], a European initiative to enforce OA,
cap APCs and prohibit publishing in hybrid journals.  Whilst we
support the notions underlying plan S, until further details are
released (e.g. the nature of the APC cap, recognition of green and
diamond OA).
