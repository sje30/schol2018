# Background from publisher

<pre>

Therefore, I wanted to get in touch as we are putting together an
issue of our interdisciplinary journal, Emerging Topics in Life
Sciences <http://www.emergtoplifesci.org/>, on the scholarly publishing
landscape, with the focus being on the current impact on and
implications for life science researchers. The issue would cover a
number of aspects of the scholarly publishing landscape, including
research data, open science, persistent identifiers, models of peer
review, research ethics, and we would like to cover the view from a
life science researcher. In particular, thinking about the following
questions:


*         What does the scholarly publishing landscape look like in
	  2018 (from a life scientists perspective)?

*         What are the considerations, regulations and expectations
	  from the perspective of a life science researcher, and what
	  do the pros and cons of compliance look like to them?

*         How are emerging topics in scholarly publishing improving or holding back the science?

Would you be interested in writing a short perspective piece on
emerging topics in scholarly publishing and the impact and implication
for the life science researcher? We are asking for short
(approx. 1000-1500 words) pieces. Given that this issue needs to be
published before the end of the year, we would need submission of the
piece in the next few weeks (1 November deadline).  </pre>
