Q3: abstract


We outline recent developments in scholarly publishing that we think
will improve the working environment and career prospects for life
scientists.  Most prominently, we discuss two key developments. (1)
Life scientists are now embracing a preprint culture leading to rapid
dissemination of research findings.  (2) We outline steps to overcome
the reproducibility crisis.  We also briefly describe other innovations in
scholarly publishing, along with changes to open access mandates from
funding agencies.

Q4: okay.  For consistency, you might wish to italicise ASAPbio.
