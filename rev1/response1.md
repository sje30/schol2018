Dear editor,

We thank the two reviewers for their comments on our paper.  Our
response to the editors is below; our revised manuscript is marked up
with changes in italics and margin notes where appropriate.

The first revision was written very much under tight word limits
(1000-1500 words); with thanks to the editor for relaxing these
constraints, we have now expanded on the manuscript (see margin note
R1a and below).

We have revised the title with this comment in mind (R1b).


 
Specific items/comments/questions: 
 
> 1. The introduction (and the later section on Open Access) feels out
>    of scope of the article - the criticism of greedy publishers at
>    the start and the discussion of open access with the throwaway
>    statement that one of the authors has experienced problems in
>    obtaining APC funds feels polemical rather than a dispassionate
>    discussion which is presented elsewhere in the article. (If this
>    introduction is meant as an abstract it needs to better describe
>    the rationale of the article and what you discuss - with you key
>    conclusions - much as a regular abstract for a research article.) 

The introduction was very much meant to be "passionate" respecting our
views on the current state of publishing.  We have however removed the
sentence later int he erport about difficulties of obtaining APC funds
to improve the flow of that section of the document.
 
> 2. You say that traditional publishing must take responsibility for

See edit R1.2.
 
> 3. Preregistration papers - it is important to state that acceptance
>    of the preregistration article does not guarantee acceptance of
>    the subsequent results-based article. 

See edit R1.3.
 
> 4. Reproducible manuscripts - you may also want to reference Cloud
>    Ocean which allows for sharing and embedding (I think) code
>    within articles - it recently announced a pilot with Nature - see

Added, thank you (edit R1.4).
 
> 5. Other recent innovations - this feels like a checklist - it would
>    add value to explain why you have included ORCID - what does it
>    add to ensuring reproducible science? The other items would
>    benefit from a little more explanation of what they contribute

Done (edit R1.5a, R1.5b, R1.5c, R1.5d, R1.5e).
 
> 6. You have not mentioned reporting guidelines and journal policies
>    that advocate the use of these - e.g. the Equator initiative
>    which aims to support authors, editors, peer reviewers on better
>    reporting of science - https://www.equator-network.org - surely
>    this would be included under initiatives to support reproducible
>    science? 

We have now described the reporting guidelines published in 2015 (R1.6).
 
> 7. And initiatives to publish negative results? (although there is
>    nothing formal so far as I am aware - are the authors aware of
>    anything about this topic?) 

This was effectively included in our first revision where we described
an increase in null results reported (ref 7) from pre-registered
studies.


 
# Reviewer 2
 
> p3, last line of 'Funder mandates...'. The authors cite 'green and diamond OA'. Don't they mean 'green and gold OA'? In any event, it would be helpful here to provide an explanatory sentence about these different forms of OA. 
 
TODO

# Other changes

We mistakenly referred to PubPeer in our first version, when we
actually meant Publons (edit O1).

SJE is now an affiliate of BioRxiv (edit O2).
